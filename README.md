### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: A Data Story about ANES in 2016
+ This project is conducted by Shuyuan Wang, sw3449

+ Project summary: Voters in America will decide on 3 November whether Donald Trump remains in the White House for another four years. Speaking of President Trump, his victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election stunned many political observers and pollsters who expected Hillary to be the winner. In this project, I would like to look deeper into the supporters for these two president candidates using the ANES 2016 Time Series data. The questions I want to answer with the data are:

1. What were different candidates' supporters' opinion on Obama, the previous president? 
    * More specifically, what were their affect direction and their feeling thermometer values?

2. How many interviewers voted for Hillary and Trump? 
    * Where did they locate?
    * Was the survey data consistent with the actual result?

+ Main findings:

    * Interviewees who voted for Hillary Clinton showed positive attitude towards Barack Obama, and the interviewees who supported Donald Trump had quite the opposite attitude.
    * What the survey data suggests about the state-wise support for Hillary and Trump is not consistent with the reality.
