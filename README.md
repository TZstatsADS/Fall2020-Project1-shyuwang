### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: Who voted Trump in 2016?
+ This project is conducted by Shuyuan Wang, sw3449

+ Project summary: Voters in America will decide on 3 November whether Donald Trump remains in the White House for another four years. Speaking of President Trump, his victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election stunned many political observers and pollsters who expected Hillary to be the winner. In this project, I would like to look deeper into the voters using the ANES 2016 Time Series data. The questions I want to answer with the data are:

    * What are the characteristics of the interviewees that voted for Donald Trump?
    
        * What were their opinion on Obama, the previous president? 

        * What were their opinion on the U.S. economy since 2008?

        * What were their opinion on gay marriage? 

    * Additionally: What does the data say about the 2016 presidential election result? Is it consistent with the actual result?


+ Main findings:

    * Trump voters were not fans of Barack Obama; they were not satisfied with the U.S. economy during Obama's presidency and prioritized the U.S. economy; they were not proponent of gay marriage
    * What the survey data suggests about the state-wise support for Hillary and Trump is not consistent with the reality.
